# Flight-Price-prediction

## Business Problem
####  The flight ticket price in India is based on demand and supply model with few restrictions on pricing from regulatory bodies. It is often perceived as unpredictable and , recent dynamic pricing scheme added to the confusion. The objective is to create a machine learning model for predicting the flight price, based on historical data, which can be used for reference price for customers as well as airline service providers.
### Goal
#### Creating a machine learning for predicting flight ticket price with high accuracy.
